# JTAG is on FTDI B channel so it doesn't inadvertently assert flash CS pin
# (usually UART would be on the B channel).

# Note TDO/TMS require two of the solder jumpers on the back of the board to
# be bridged. On the v1.0e board these are jumpers J3/J4. To find these, look
# for the box of 5 x 2 jumpers (with a few others hanging off the side) and
# they are the two in the central column. They line up with the space in
# between "Jump" and "for" in the silk text "Jump for FTDI FIFO".

# UART is moved over to FTDI A channel -- this means flash is inaccessible
# (and stays in a quiescent state since CSn is disconnected and pulled high)
