+ *
+ *              In this C version, the following C library functions are used:

+ *              - printf, scanf (outside the measurement loop)
+ *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"

+ * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
+ *      -DREG          (default: Not defined)
+ *              As an approximation to what an average C programmer
+ *              might do, causes the "register" storage class to be applied
+ *              - for local variables, if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                five or more times
+ *              - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                six or more times
+ *              Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
+ *              compiler-dependent, and that "register" declarations
+ *              do not necessarily lead to faster execution.
+ *      -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
+ *              Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *              assignment of structures.
+ *      -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
+ *              Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *              enumeration types.
+ *      -DTIMES                 (default)
+ *      -DTIME
+ *              The "times" function of UNIX (returning process times)
+ *              or the "time" function (returning wallclock time)
+ *              is used for measurement. 
+ *              For single user machines, "time ()" is adequate. For
+ *              multi-user machines where you cannot get single-user
+ *              access, use the "times ()" function. If you have
+ *              neither, use a stopwatch in the dead of night.
+ *              "printf"s are provided marking the points "Start Timer"
+ *              and "Stop Timer". DO NOT use the UNIX "time(1)"
+ *              command, as this will measure the total time to
+ *              run this program, which will (erroneously) include
+ *              the time to allocate storage (malloc) and to perform
+ *              the initialization.
+ *      -DHZ=nnn
+ *              In Berkeley UNIX, the function "times" returns process
+ *              time in 1/HZ seconds, with HZ = 60 for most systems.
+ *              CHECK YOUR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU JUST APPLY
+ *              A VALUE.
+ *
+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ *  History:	Version C/2.1 was made for two reasons:
+ *
+ *	1) There was an obvious need for a common C version of
+ *      Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
+ *      programming language for the class of processors
+ *      (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used most.
+ *      There should be, as far as possible, only one C version of
+ *      Dhrystone such that results can be compared without
+ *      restrictions. In the past, the C versions distributed
+ *      by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by Reinhold Weicker
+ *      had small (though not significant) differences.
+ *
+ *      2) As far as it is possible without changes to the Dhrystone
+ *      statistics, optimizing compilers should be prevented from
+ *      removing significant statements.
+ *
+ *      This C version has been developed in cooperation with
+ *      Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
+ *      ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
+ *      him over the UNIX network Usenet.
+ *      I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
+ *      David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
+ *      Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
+ *      for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
+ *      benchmark.
+ *
+ *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
+ *      Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
+ *      version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *      As a concession to older compilers, names have been made
+ *      unique within the first 8 characters.
+ *      Inside the measurement loop, this version follows the
+ *      version previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *
+ *      At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
+ *      but within the measurement loop only in branches that 
+ *      are not executed. The intention is that optimizing compilers
+ *      should be prevented from moving code out of the measurement
+ *      loop, or from removing code altogether. Since the statements
+ *      that are executed within the measurement loop have NOT been
+ *      changed, the numbers defining the "Dhrystone distribution"
+ *      (distribution of statements, operand types and locality)
+ *      still hold. Except for sophisticated optimizing compilers,
+ *      execution times for this version should be the same as
+ *      for previous versions.
+ *
+ *      Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
+ *      measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
+ *      has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
+ *      an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
+ *      statistics which have been updated for this version.
+ *
+ *      All changes within the measurement loop are described
+ *      and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
+ *      Dhrystone version 2".
+ *
+ *      Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
+ *      distribution of the executed statements should not be
+ *      changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
+ *      may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
+ *      degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic benchmarks.
+ *      Users of the benchmark are advised to check code listings
+ *      whether code is generated for all statements of Dhrystone.
+ *
+ *      Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
+ *      the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it corrects
+ *      some minor deficiencies that were found by users of version 2.0.
+ *      The only change within the measurement loop is that a
+ *      non-executed "else" part was added to the "if" statement in
+ *      Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part removed from Proc_3.
+ *
+ * Version C/2.2, Steven Pemberton, October 1993
+ *	Functionally, identical to version 2.2; the changes are in
+ *	how you compile and use it:
+ *	- Everything is in one file now, but compiled in 2 passes
+ *	- Compile (and run) by running the file through the shell: 'sh dhry.c"
+ *	- Uses the system definition of HZ if one can be found
+ *	- HZ must be defined, otherwise it won't compile (no defaults here)
+ *	- The (uninteresting) output is printed to stderr (dhry2 > /dev/null)
+ *	- The number of loops is passed as a parameter, rather than read
+ *	  (dhry2 500000)
+ *	- If the number of loops is insufficient to get a good result,
+ *	  it repeats it with loops*10 until it is enough (rather than just
+ *	  stopping)
+ *	- Output says which sort of clock it is using, and the HZ value
+ *	- You can use -DREG instead of the -DREG=register of previous versions
+ *	- Some stylistic cleanups.
+ *		
+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
+ *
+ *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
+ *  - Separate compilation
+ *  - No procedure merging
+ *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be indicated
+ *  - Default results are those without register declarations
+ *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
+ *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
+ *
+ *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
+ *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
+ *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system used.
+ *

+ *
+ *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
+ *
+ *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
+ *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
+ *   different from the Ada version.]
+ *
+ *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
+ *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:           
+ *
+ *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
+ *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
+ *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
+ *
+ *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
+ *  respect to the three aspects:                                             
+ *
+ *    - statement type
+ *    - operand type
+ *    - operand locality
+ *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.                     
+ *
+ *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.

+/*  File:       dhry_1.c (part 2 of 3)
+ *  Author:     Reinhold P. Weicker
+ *              Siemens Nixdorf, Paderborn/Germany
+ *              weicker@specbench.org
+ *  Date:       May 25, 1988
+ *  Modified:	Steven Pemberton, CWI, Amsterdam; Steven.Pemberton@cwi.nl
+ *  Date:       October, 1993; March 1995
+ *              Included both files into one source, that gets compiled
+ *              in two passes. Made program auto-compiling, and auto-running,
+ *              and generally made it much easier to use.
+ *
+ *              Original Version (in Ada) published in
+ *              "Communications of the ACM" vol. 27., no. 10 (Oct. 1984),
+ *              pp. 1013 - 1030, together with the statistics
+ *              on which the distribution of statements etc. is based.
+ *
+ *              In this C version, the following C library functions are used:
+ *              - strcpy, strcmp (inside the measurement loop)
+ *              - printf, scanf (outside the measurement loop)
+ *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"
+ *              are used for execution time measurement. For measurements
+ *              on other systems, these calls have to be changed.
+ *
+ *  Collection of Results:
+ *              Reinhold Weicker (address see above) and
+ *

+ *
+ *      Please send results to Rick Richardson and/or Reinhold Weicker.
+ *      Complete information should be given on hardware and software used.
+ *      Hardware information includes: Machine type, CPU, type and size
+ *      of caches; for microprocessors: clock frequency, memory speed
+ *      (number of wait states).
+ *      Software information includes: Compiler (and runtime library)
+ *      manufacturer and version, compilation switches, OS version.
+ *      The Operating System version may give an indication about the compiler;
+ *      Dhrystone itself performs no OS calls in the measurement loop.
+ *
+ *      The complete output generated by the program should be mailed
+ *      such that at least some checks for correctness can be made.

+ *
+ * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
+ *      -DREG          (default: Not defined)
+ *              As an approximation to what an average C programmer
+ *              might do, causes the "register" storage class to be applied
+ *              - for local variables, if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                five or more times
+ *              - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                six or more times
+ *              Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
+ *              compiler-dependent, and that "register" declarations
+ *              do not necessarily lead to faster execution.
+ *      -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
+ *              Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *              assignment of structures.
+ *      -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
+ *              Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *              enumeration types.

+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ *  History:	Version C/2.1 was made for two reasons:
+ *
+ *	1) There was an obvious need for a common C version of
+ *      Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
+ *      programming language for the class of processors
+ *      (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used most.
+ *      There should be, as far as possible, only one C version of
+ *      Dhrystone such that results can be compared without
+ *      restrictions. In the past, the C versions distributed
+ *      by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by Reinhold Weicker
+ *      had small (though not significant) differences.
+ *
+ *      2) As far as it is possible without changes to the Dhrystone
+ *      statistics, optimizing compilers should be prevented from
+ *      removing significant statements.
+ *
+ *      This C version has been developed in cooperation with
+ *      Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
+ *      ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
+ *      him over the UNIX network Usenet.
+ *      I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
+ *      David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
+ *      Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
+ *      for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
+ *      benchmark.
+ *
+ *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
+ *      Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
+ *      version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *      As a concession to older compilers, names have been made
+ *      unique within the first 8 characters.
+ *      Inside the measurement loop, this version follows the
+ *      version previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *
+ *      At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
+ *      but within the measurement loop only in branches that 
+ *      are not executed. The intention is that optimizing compilers
+ *      should be prevented from moving code out of the measurement
+ *      loop, or from removing code altogether. Since the statements
+ *      that are executed within the measurement loop have NOT been
+ *      changed, the numbers defining the "Dhrystone distribution"
+ *      (distribution of statements, operand types and locality)
+ *      still hold. Except for sophisticated optimizing compilers,
+ *      execution times for this version should be the same as
+ *      for previous versions.
+ *
+ *      Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
+ *      measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
+ *      has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
+ *      an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
+ *      statistics which have been updated for this version.
+ *
+ *      All changes within the measurement loop are described
+ *      and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
+ *      Dhrystone version 2".
+ *
+ *      Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
+ *      distribution of the executed statements should not be
+ *      changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
+ *      may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
+ *      degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic benchmarks.
+ *      Users of the benchmark are advised to check code listings
+ *      whether code is generated for all statements of Dhrystone.
+ *
+ *      Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
+ *      the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it corrects
+ *      some minor deficiencies that were found by users of version 2.0.
+ *      The only change within the measurement loop is that a
+ *      non-executed "else" part was added to the "if" statement in
+ *      Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part removed from Proc_3.
+ *
+ * Version C/2.2, Steven Pemberton, October 1993
+ *	Functionally, identical to version 2.2; the changes are in
+ *	how you compile and use it:
+ *	- Everything is in one file now, but compiled in 2 passes
+ *	- Compile (and run) by running the file through the shell: 'sh dhry.c"
+ *	- Uses the system definition of HZ if one can be found
+ *	- HZ must be defined, otherwise it won't compile (no defaults here)
+ *	- The (uninteresting) output is printed to stderr (dhry2 > /dev/null)
+ *	- The number of loops is passed as a parameter, rather than read
+ *	  (dhry2 500000)
+ *	- If the number of loops is insufficient to get a good result,
+ *	  it repeats it with loops*10 until it is enough (rather than just
+ *	  stopping)
+ *	- Output says which sort of clock it is using, and the HZ value
+ *	- You can use -DREG instead of the -DREG=register of previous versions
+ *	- Some stylistic cleanups.
+ *		
+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
+ *
+ *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
+ *  - Separate compilation
+ *  - No procedure merging
+ *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be indicated
+ *  - Default results are those without register declarations
+ *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
+ *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
+ *
+ *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
+ *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
+ *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system used.

+ *
+ *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
+ *
+ *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
+ *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
+ *   different from the Ada version.]
+ *
+ *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
+ *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:           
+ *
+ *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
+ *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
+ *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
+ *
+ *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
+ *  respect to the three aspects:                                             
+ *
+ *    - statement type
+ *    - operand type
+ *    - operand locality
+ *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.                     
+ *
+ *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.
